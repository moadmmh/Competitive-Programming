# Competitive Programming Course:
  Well i have been in competitive programming for a while (7 months) there's a good improvement since the day i started and i can see that through the mindset i uilt in this period but that's not enough i always aimed to get to a higher level and to do so i have been looking for good maps since then and i finally got a good road map as a starting tool. 

T-414-AFLV was made by [Bjarki Ágúst Guðmundsson](https://github.com/SuprDewd) in 2016.
# Why this course exactly ?
  Well,nobody can deny the fact that there are a punch of Great road maps and competitive programming resources (books,videos...) but that doesn't make all of these helpful for some of us since the way we get knowledge differs from one to another 
  
  I liked how the courses will be given and the creativity of the problem set for each specific topic .
